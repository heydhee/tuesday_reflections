#2 Skills and mastery

Part of the reason why people never embark on learning a skill is that it takes time, a lot of it when you consider 10000 hour theory which is 8 hours of focussed and intense work every day for 5 years. The first few hours of learning a skill are pure hell. You always would have something more important to do than what you actually want to do just like I would want to surf through Twitter than writing this article. You are overwhelmed with the goal you set for yourself.


Days are gone when you have to go to college to get a degree to get a job. In today’s day and age, it is important to get hold of skills to land a job. You can do it from anywhere because now education is free on YouTube. But we don't know how much skill to gain and most self-education gurus fail at this. They keep on learning the same thing even though they know that they never stop watching tutorials. At some point, they give up learning where they never learnt anything so far but just watched a few tutorials (though gained some knowledge on the domain). 

Sometimes the thought that you have to spend 10,000 hours to learn a skill itself is a disaster. Since it could be your potential reason for not learning anything at all.

We don't realise the very fact that Gladwell's research was done on high expertise and mastery such that of grandmasters in chess, scientists, and Olympic level athletes.

People don't need to be experts in all of the skills they possess. Sometimes they need to learn just enough to use it in their own lives.

This is when I came across a TED talk by Josh Kaufman “The First 20 Hours” where I was kind of convinced that you pick up a skill with 20 hours of focused and intense work. This idea really helps someone who has buckets of skills in their to-learn list.

Since this idea piqued my mind I've also started reading his book “The 20 hour rule”. I don't know if someone could learn a skill within 20 hours since I haven't done it. But I definitely know if learning was made simple it would motivate many to learn the things they always wanted to do.
